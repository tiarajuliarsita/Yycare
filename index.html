        <b> Sleep Well:</b> The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends
        between 8â€“10 hours of sleep per night for teenagers and over 7 hours for
        those ages 20 and up. But sleeping well also refers to when you sleep
        and the quality of that sleep.

        <b>Connect With Others: </b> Friends, family, pets...even a casual
        friendly hello to a stranger can boost positive feelings, help ward off
        depression and anxiety, and make you feel that you are connected to
        others.

        <b>Find Support (and Be Supportive):</b> If you or someone you know is
        struggling, find support. This might be a friend or a family member. Or
        it could be reaching out to a counselor, a primary care doctor, or a
        mental health professional. If the person you find isn't giving you the
        kind of support you need, look for another support option that is better
        for you and your needs.

        <b> Exercise:</b> Even taking a short walk or climbing a flight of
        stairs can reduce stress and increase alertness. A regular exercise
        routine can boost one's mood, increase concentration, and even help
        alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.

        <b>Eat Healthy:</b>Vegetables and fruits? Absolutely! Nutritious foods.
        Sure. Don't drink 10 cups of anything in a day, unless it's water. But
        healthy eating also means having a healthy attitude toward food. Enjoy
        meals with friends, try new foods and try not to obsess over food. If
        you do find that your relationship to food is affecting your mental or
        physical health, get the facts on eating disorders and take the
        important step of finding help.

        <b>Be Nice to Yourself:</b>When you are feeling down, it is easy to be
        hard on yourself. While you might not be of the mind to congratulate or
        compliment yourself, try being compassionate. And here is a little bonus
        hint: If you really are struggling to be nice to yourself, do something
        nice for someone else. Then, compliment yourself on doing it!

      <section class="tujuh">
        <b> Breathe Deep:</b> Just try it. Take in a nice slow breath. Start
        from your belly; expand through your ribs, chest, and lungs. Breathe out
        just as slowly. Counting can help ("1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...") Repeat.

        <b>Take Small Steps:</b> If you try to do everything at once, you will
        probably get nowhere. Set goals, and then draw that dotted line from
        point A to B to C. Stop and rest along the way. You will thank yourself
        for it.
